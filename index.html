        <h2>Welcome to the ECPL Management System</h2>
        <p>
            With Emerald City's growing population, more residents than ever are turning to the **Emerald City Public Library (ECPL)** for their reading needs.
            Daily patron registrations have doubled, and book circulation has reached record highs.
        </p>
        <p>
            To support this rapid growth, ECPL is upgrading from an outdated system to a **modern, database-driven platform**.
            Our system streamlines book management, organizes author records, and efficiently tracks patron borrowing activity.
            Whether the library continues to expand its collection or welcomes new members, our system is designed to scale seamlessly.
